    <h3>Brief Explanation why</h3>
    <p>I think this one is more along the line of love at first type sort of thing.
        Like when I first saw the pokemon I instantely knew that this one is my favourite pokemon.
        I like the design of the pokemon a lot, and the shint is pretty unique as well.
        Then there is the lore aspect about the pokemon which makes it even cooler.</p>

    <h3>Brief Explanation why</h3>
    <p>I just like this pokemon's design and lore really thats about it.
        I guess this is usually where the person cheers for the underdog scenerio.
        Since there are definitely more powerful pokemon, and nothing else about
        this pokemon stands out, but I still really like it.
